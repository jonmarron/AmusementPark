Amusement Park
We want to digitize our amusement park system. We have various rides our customers can go on. Each ride has a name, a price, and the maximum number of customers they can run with at the same time. Each ride also has a queue of customers to admit and the list of actual customers on the ride. We want to make sure that our rides are always fully utilized when there are customers queueing, so ensure that all our rides can be run. A ride can be rotating, aquatic, train, or driveable.

When our customers enter the park, they choose a payment plan: Budget or VIP. We want to keep track of their name and the rides they went on. At the end of their stay, budget customers pay based on their ride usage, while VIP customers pay a fixed amount of 600 (so we ignore the price of rides for them). We want to be able to calculate how much each customer needs to pay when they leave the park. We also ask from VIP customers when they enter the park whether it's their first time or not at our park and track their answer.

VIP customers get priority on the queues, so when they enter a queue they can always go to the front. (Because we only have a few VIP customers, them going in front of each other has not caused any problems so far as they all get admitted at the same time to the ride.)

We want to be able to get what ride generates the most profit per run with 100% Budget customers.
